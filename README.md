# App Icon Resizer

If you have to maintain an iOS / Android app and re-generate app icons in different resolutions all the time,
If your designer likes to give you a vectorial asset a does not generate proper assets from it.
Well this can take care of that.

This is a quick and dirty hack of an existing image magic script I found in GH.
Now it will resize a source image into all the sizes listed in a file.

Sizes are described as a list of coma separated integers. Sizes are expressed in px. (not pt)

Install Python and ImageMagick from mac-ports or whatever you like.

ex of use case :

then (macOS)
```
open .
```

Voila !
